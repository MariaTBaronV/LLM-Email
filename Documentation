1. Working Implementation
The provided Python script implements an automated email classification and response generation system using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. The system:
•	Validates incoming emails for completeness.
•	Classifies emails into predefined categories (complaint, inquiry, feedback, support_request, other).
•	Generates empathetic and clear responses based on email content and classification.
•	Simulates sending responses and handling tasks such as ticket creation or logging feedback.
2. Documentation of Approach
The implemented pipeline includes:
EmailProcessor class:
•	Validates emails to ensure required fields are present.
•	Utilizes GPT-3.5 for email classification and response generation using clearly structured prompts.
EmailAutomationSystem class:
•	Manages end-to-end processing of each email.
•	Triggers specific handlers based on the email classification.
Mock Functions:
•	Simulate external services (sending responses, creating tickets, logging feedback).
3. Example Run
Please check on the Example_Run.txt document in the folder.

4. Documentation of Prompt Iterations
Please check on the prompt.txt document in the folder.

Problems encountered:
•	Initial minor typos in the prompt (e.g., spacing and spelling inconsistencies).
•	Ensured clear instruction to return only the category to avoid inconsistent results.
Improvements made:
•	Corrected typos and standardized prompt structure for clarity and consistency.
•	Adjusted GPT-3.5 API call temperature to 0 for consistent classification results.

5. Brief Summary

Design Decisions:
•	Modular structure for clarity and maintainability.
•	Clear separation between validation, classification, response generation, and handling tasks.
Challenges Encountered:
•	Ensuring classification consistency.
•	Handling potential API exceptions gracefully.
Potential Improvements:
•	Implement caching mechanisms to optimize API usage.
•	Include detailed logging for monitoring and auditing.
•	Integrate manual verification for sensitive classifications.
Production Considerations:
•	Management of OpenAI API costs and rate limits.
•	Secure handling of API keys and sensitive email data.
•	Compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.
